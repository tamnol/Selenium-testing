# Selenium-testing
Selenium  web components automation testing using VS code ide

this project consists of building an automate testing environment by leveraging on components such as: 
## A proprietary chrome driver 32 package for windows,
## A Selenium Jar zip file,
## Other Jar Files for the JUnit testing (Junit-4-13.2) and (java-dotenv-5.2.2) for the environment variables configuration.
all these to allow a project that is less host environment reliant and easy to deploy.
The project is implemented on the windows VS code IDE with the free AI kite autocompletion plug in.
